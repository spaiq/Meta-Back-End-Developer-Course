# Meta Backend Developer Course Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to the practical exercises from the Meta Backend Developer course. It does not contain tasks done using the coursera Lab feature.

## Structure

The repository is structured into three main directories:

1. `Back-End-Developer-Capstone/` - Contains the capstone project for the backend developer course.
2. `Introduction-to-Back-End-Development/` - Contains weekly exercises and projects from the Introduction to Backend Development module.
3. `Programming-in-Python/` - Contains weekly exercises and projects from the Programming in Python module.

Back-End-Developer-Capstone directory contains its own `README.md` file explaining the task and my solution.

## Note

This project is not open for contributions. It is here to showcase my solutions to the practical exercises from the course.
